How many meter has sensor?
4716

How many records do each sensor have?
select * from frequence

Create interval of each records of each sensor?

Create view interval1 (spaceid, occupancystate, eventtime, prev, diff)
as
select  spaceid, occupancystate,eventtime,
lag(eventtime,1) over(partition by spaceid order by eventtime)as prev,
(eventtime - lag(eventtime,1) over(partition by spaceid order by eventtime))*24*60 as diff
from status;




How frequent?

create view update_interval(spaceid, occupancystate, eventtime, prev, diff, avg_update_time)
as
select spaceid, occupancystate, eventtime, prev, diff,
avg(diff) over(partition by spaceid) as avg_update_time
from interval1
order by avg_update_time;


Why some are more frequent than other ?
is it depend on area or time?

Consider cut off those record with is over 10 min.
Consider cut off those record with distance over 1 mile.
